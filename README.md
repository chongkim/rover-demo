INSTRUCTIONS
============

Install all the requirements

```
npm install
```

Build:
```
npm run build
```

You can see the page either by visiting the `index.html` file directly or by runnig the webpack-dev-server via
`npm start` and navigating to `http://localhost:8080/`.

Click "Choose File" to update the `input.txt` file that is included in the root directory.

You will see an animation of the rover (indicated by `A`) following the instructions.
At the end of the animation, you will see the resulting output in the `Output` section. 
For reference, I have included the `Input` section so you can verify that the file has
been read correctly.

TODO
====

There is no test and the display is very basic.
